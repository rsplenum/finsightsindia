The subjects must be completely isolated with no background scenery, rooms, or borders. Bold black inking, expressive narrative, and rich colors (deep navy and institutional gold). Subject: An anxious small business owner looking at a glowing red tax notice on a tablet, while a shady supplier in the background runs away with a bag of GST money. The vibe is dramatic, high-stakes financial tension.",

The subjects must be completely isolated with no background scenery, rooms, or borders. Bold black inking, expressive narrative, and rich colors (deep navy and institutional gold). Subject: A taxpayer looking horrified at an Income Tax notice, while a shadowy figure representing a fake charity holds a stamped 80G certificate that is dissolving into dust or fading away. The vibe is dramatic, high-stakes financial tension.",

The subjects must be completely isolated with no background scenery, rooms, or borders. Bold black inking, expressive narrative, and rich colors (deep navy and institutional gold). Subject: A stressed young day-trader sitting at a laptop with a giant red 'REBATE DENIED' stamp hitting their screen, shattering a shield labeled '87A'. The vibe is dramatic, high-stakes financial tension."
